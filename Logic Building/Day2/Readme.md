	-int, public, private, abstract....
	-case sensitive
	
## 2.Identifiers:
	-user defined tokens/ programmer defined tokens
	-classname, methodname, intrfacename;
	-int p1=5, PI=3, pi=4
	
## 3.Literals:
	-Constant
	-sequence of characters or constants
	-length can be anything
	-Uppercase & lowercase 
		P=3.14
		pi1=3.12

## 4.Operators:
	Arithmetic operator: +,-.*,/,%
	Relational operator: <,<=,>,>=,==,!=
	Logical operator: And && Or ||, Not !
	Bitwise operator: <<, >>
	Assignment operator: +=,-=,*=,/=
	a+=10  => a=a+10;
	Increment and Decrement operator: ++,--
	E.g: int p=5;
			++p: pre increment
			p++: post increment
			--p: pre decrement
